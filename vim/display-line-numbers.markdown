# Display Line Numbers

Displaying line numbers in vim can be very useful for troubleshooting programming errors and parsing code.

In order to display line numbers, press <code>ESC</code> and enter the command:

```
:set number
```
To disable the numbers enter command mode again and type:

```
:set nonumber
```
You can make this permanent by adding a line to your vimrc file but I prefer to only enable it when I need it.
