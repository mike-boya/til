# Changing Your MAC Address

There are times, specifically during wireless assessments, when you need to change your MAC address. The reasons for this could include - evading detection or bypassing MAC filtering. The tool [macchanger](https://github.com/alobbs/macchanger) makes this simple from the command line.

Here are the steps to change your MAC address to 'aa:bb:cc:11:22:33' on wlan0:

1. Show the current MAC Address:
```
bash macchanger -s wlan0 
```
2. Take down the interface:
```bash 
ifconfig wlan0 down
```
3. Run macchanger and provide the new MAC address:
```bash 
macchanger --mac=aa:bb:cc:11:22:33 wlan0
```
4. Bring the interface back up:
```bash 
ifconfig wlan0 up
```
5. Verify the modified MAC:
```bash 
macchanger -s wlan0
```
Run the same steps to set the MAC address back, replacing step 3 with:
```bash
macchanger -p wlan0
```
Another useful option is (--list), which will list out Vendor MAC addresses. This can be helpful when selecting a new address. 

For example, if I needed to impersonate a printer:

```bash
macchanger --list=Hewlett-Packard
Misc MACs:
Num    MAC        Vendor
---    ---        ------
0487 - 00:01:e6 - Hewlett-Packard Company
0488 - 00:01:e7 - Hewlett-Packard Company
0678 - 00:02:a5 - Hewlett-Packard Company
1259 - 00:04:ea - Hewlett-Packard Company
2051 - 00:08:02 - Hewlett-Packard Company
2153 - 00:08:83 - Hewlett-Packard Company
```
