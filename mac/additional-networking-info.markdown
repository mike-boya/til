# Additional Networking Info

I had serious "Wow!" moment when I discovered this. Hold down the *option* key 
when clicking the WiFi icon in the top right of your screen and you will be 
presented with additional networking info. This info includes (but is not limited to):

* Interface Name
* MAC Address
* Current IP Address
* Channel
* Tx Rate
* Noise

There is a lot more on the menu, so check it out to see what would be the most
useful for you. In most cases, I would default to the command line, but sometimes
having your MAC address handy with a simple click is just more efficient.
