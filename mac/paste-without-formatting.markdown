# Paste Without Formatting

This is a short TIL, but saves me time on a daily basis. When I paste something
into a document, I almost never want the original formatting included.

To paste without formatting, hold down Shift + Option + Command and hit V.

Admittedly, this is not the easiest keyboard combination to master, but it is more
efficient then trying to remove original formatting from the pasted text.
