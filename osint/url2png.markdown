# URL2PNG

When investigating potentially malicious links a quick view of the page is sometimes necessary.

There are a number of sites that offer this functionality, but I prefer URL2PNG because it provides
a clean interface that is not covered with ads. The true purpose of URL2PNG is URL screenshot automation
for apps, but the "Test Drive" option is sufficient for a quick look up.

Simply navigate to <code>https://www.url2png.com/</code> and input the URL you are investigating.

This tool is very useful when performing initial recon on phishing links that direct the user to a credential 
harvesting site. Additional analysis should take place but this provides an excellent first look at the site.
