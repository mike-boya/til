# Run a Pcap Through Snort

Snort is an open source intrusion prevention system capable of real-time traffic
analysis and packet logging. Snort can read and alert on pcap files. This feature
is extremely useful during network security monitoring and analysis.

Read the pcap using <code>snort -r</code>:

```bash
mike@foo:~/pcaps$ snort -c etc/snort.conf -l log/ -r attacker-activity.pcap
```
The default location for the log directory is <code>/var/log/snort/</code> but I prefer 
to use <code>-l</code> to log the results in a specific directory for the pcap.

Parse through the alert file generated by snort to review the generated alerts.

```bash
mike@foo:~/pcaps$ cat log/alert
[**] [1:553:7] POLICY FTP anonymous login attempt [**]

```

I have included an example alert above (IPs have been modified to protect the guilty).
