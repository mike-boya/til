# TIL (Today I Learned)

>“Learning never exhausts the mind.”  ―Leonardo da Vinci

This is a collection of things I have learned. These are short write-ups that I chose not to formalize with a full-length post on my [blog](http://mike-boya.github.io/).

I was inspired by [jbranchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud) after being directed to his TIL by a *lifehacker* article.

I hope to achieve a few things with this repo:
* Encourage myself to learn and document **at least** one new thing a day
* Ensure that I am staying up-to-date on git and some of the advanced features
* Create a useful reference for myself and others 

Enjoy!
